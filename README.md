<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project arises from the fact that whenever one left the computer unlocked at work, colleagues changed the wallpaper, changed the computer settings or any other joke you can imagine.

As a result of all this arises the idea of creating a configurable screensaver with any type of image or HTML file to "lock" the PC screen and say that you are going to do or where you are.
